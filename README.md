GraphTest

GraphTest is a Java project that demonstrates the creation and manipulation of a graph data structure. This project allows you to create an undirected and weighted graph, add and remove edges, and retrieve information about the graph. The project includes functionality for basic graph operations as well as searching and finding shortest paths using Dijkstra's algorithm.

Usage

Run the GraphTest program:

This will execute the main method in the GraphTest class, which performs the following steps:

1.Creates an undirected and weighted graph.
2.Adds vertices labeled "1" to "5" with names of cities in Kazakhstan.
3.Adds edges between some of the vertices.
4.Checks for the existence of certain edges and prints the results.
5.Retrieves and prints the neighbors of a specific vertex.

6.Prints the graph.

7.Removes an edge and prints the graph again to show the change.
